# API Controllers

## Overview
The `controllers` folder contains business logic for handling API requests. Each controller corresponds to a specific route.

## Folder Structure
```
controllers/
├── userController.js   # Business logic for user-related operations
├── transactionController.js # Business logic for transaction-related operations
└── ...                 # Additional controller files
```

## Development
1. Implement business logic in the appropriate controller file.
2. Ensure controllers handle request validation and error handling.
3. Export functions for use in route definitions.
