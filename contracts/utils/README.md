# Utility Contracts

## Overview
The `utils` folder contains reusable utility contracts for common blockchain operations.

## Folder Structure
```
utils/
├── SafeMath.sol        # Library for safe mathematical operations
├── AddressUtils.sol    # Utility functions for address validation
└── ...                 # Additional utility contracts
```

## Development
1. Write utility contracts in Solidity.
2. Ensure contracts are modular and reusable.
3. Test utility functions independently.
