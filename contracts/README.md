# Contracts Module

## Overview
The `contracts` module contains Solana smart contracts for core functionalities, including token management, DeFi operations, and utility contracts.

## Features
- Token contracts for custom token issuance.
- DeFi contracts for staking, lending, and liquidity pools.
- Utility contracts for reusable blockchain logic.

## Folder Structure
```
contracts/
├── tokens/             # Token-related contracts
├── defi/               # DeFi-related contracts
├── utils/              # Utility contracts
└── README.md           # Module overview
```

## Development
1. Write smart contracts in the appropriate subfolder (e.g., `tokens/`, `defi/`).
2. Use Solana's development tools for testing and deployment.
3. Follow best practices for security and optimization.
