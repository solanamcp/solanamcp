- Shared utilities for backend operations.

## Folder Structure
```
services/
├── llm/                # LLM-related services
├── blockchain/         # Blockchain interaction services
├── utils/              # Shared utilities for backend services
└── README.md           # Module overview
```

## Development
1. Implement LLM-related logic in the `llm/` folder.
2. Add blockchain interaction logic in the `blockchain/` folder.
3. Place reusable utilities in the `utils/` folder.
